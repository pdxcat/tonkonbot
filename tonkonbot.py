"""
An example IRC log bot - logs a channel's events to a file.

If someone says the bot's name in the channel followed by a ':',
e.g.

  <foo> logbot: hello!

the bot will reply:

  <logbot> foo: I am a log bot

Run this script with two arguments, the channel name the bot should
connect to, and file to log to, e.g.:

  $ python ircLogBot.py test test.log

will log channel #test to the file 'test.log'.
